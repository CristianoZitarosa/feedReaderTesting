### Brief introduction

This project is proposed as a practice of ***testing development***.
I have been provided of a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. Jasmine, a development framework for testing JavaScript code is already added in the project.
My task has been to learn to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against the pre-existing application.
Tests requires analyzing multiple aspects of the application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript

### How to run this application

To run this application, an user needs to download the project folder on the desktop and to unzip it. Then the user needs to locate and open in the browser (a double click on the file) the file index.html.
The result of the test of the application is visible at the bottom of the page.

### New skills applied from the Module

- Jasmine testing;

### Required features

- A README file is included detailing all steps required to successfully run the application;
- Comments are present and effectively explain longer code procedures.
- Code is formatted with consistent, logical, and easy-to-read formatting
